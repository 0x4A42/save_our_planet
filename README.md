-- About the Game --

 * Corrupt bureaucrats and selfish fat cats have left the planet in despair. They have pillaged the planet's resources for their own gain and now your assistance is required. You must spring to action and travel throughout the world in a bid to acquire renewable energy facilities and Save Our Planet! Once you acquire said renewable energy sources, you will have the opportunity to upgrade these facilities and make a greater impact in the war to Save Our Planet!

 * In the current version of the game, there are four fields consisting of areas ('properties') to acquire. The first, consisting of two areas, is representative of biomass energy. The second field, consisting of three areas, is representative of wind energy. The third field, consisting of three areas, related to solar energy. The fourth, and final, field in the game consists of two areas and relates to hydroelectric energy. 

 * A player will have the opportunity to purchase property when they land on a property square not currently owned. If they land on a property owned by another player, they will need to pay a fee to the owner (increasing with the amount of upgrades on that property). Players will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades to their properties when they own all areas within a field. For example to upgrade any property within the first field, a player would need to own both areas ('Ironbridge' and 'Polaniec').

 -- Rules --

 * Each game can have between 2 - 4 players (inclusive).

 * Players will navigate the board by rolling a pair of die - it will be possible to roll 1 - 6 (inclusive) on each die, for a max of 12. 

 * The currency used within the game is EcoCoins. Players begin with 125 EcoCoins and are awarded 75 EcoCoins each time they pass the Start square.

 * Players take turns to travel around the board. They begin on a 'Start' square. 
	- If the player lands on an area that is not owned, they will be asked if they wished to purchase it. 
	- If the player lands on an area owned by another player, they must pay an EcoCoin fee to the owner (this will scale with the amount of upgrades on the property).
	- If the player lands on the Eco-Pit Stop, nothing will happen for the rest of their turn.

 * Player names must be between 1 - 15 characters in length. Any excess length will be removed.

 * When a player is prompted to take their turn, they will have four options. 
	 - If a player selects X, you will take your turn as normal. 
	 - If a player selects U, the game will check if the player owns all areas within a field. 
		-- If the player does, they will be prompted to select which property to upgrade (if they own 3 minor upgrades, they will then be able to purchase a major upgrade). 
		-- If the player cannot purchase an upgrade, you will roll as normal. 
	- If a player selects U, they will be shown a list of their current properties and their respective upgrades. 
	- If a player selects Q, they will attempt to exit the game. 
		-- Upon pressing Y, the game will end and the winner (which cannot be the player who triggers the end the game through the menu selection) will be determined. 
		-- If the player selects N, the game will continue as normal.

 * The game ends when either a player selects Q from the menu selection or when one player runs out of money.
